# Development of an AI-Enhanced Training Simulator for Gas Refinery DCS Operators
A realistic, AI-powered simulator designed to train DCS operators in gas refineries. It replicates sensor failures, manual valve operations, and emergency scenarios to improve decision-making and reduce human error before real-world deployment.


## 1. Project Overview



This project proposes the development of a modular, AI-powered simulator that replicates key gas refinery processes in both static and dynamic modes. By integrating models from fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and chemical reaction kinetics with historical data logs, the simulator will provide realistic, scenario-driven training for Distributed Control System (DCS) operators. It will support startup and shutdown sequences, transient behaviors, and fault propagation, enabling operators to practice time-critical procedures and sequential logic under realistic conditions.

## 2. Objectives

* Simulate core gas refinery processes (e.g., gas sweetening, dehydration, fractionation, compression) using validated models from fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer, and chemical reaction kinetics to capture flow behavior, energy exchange, component separation, and reactive transformations.


* Model fluid flow behavior across pipelines, separators, and compressors using principles of fluid mechanics.


* Incorporate heat transfer mechanisms to simulate exchangers, heaters, and coolers under varying operating conditions.


* Apply mass transfer models to absorption, stripping, and separation units for accurate component distribution.

* Integrate chemical reaction kinetics for reactive processes such as sulfur removal and hydrocarbon conversion.

* Enable static (steady-state) and dynamic (time-dependent) simulation modes for key refinery units.

* Simulate startup and shutdown sequences to train operators in time-sensitive procedures.

* Ingest and analyze historical and real-time refinery data logs to enhance simulation realism.

* Provide interactive training scenarios for decision-making, fault diagnosis, and control logic.

* Support modular expansion for additional units, control strategies, and future digital twin integration.
